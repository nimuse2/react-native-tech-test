### General

Time taken: Probably in total about a day. It took me longer to set up environments. Some wrong turns. Uneccasry complications. I feel I am rusty having not been commercially coding for almost 6 months. And unfamiliar with some techniques and the database schema.

IOS/Android: Only tested on IOS

Landscape/Portrait: Need more work doing oin bigger full screen landscape

### Notes:

This is a 'lite' version. I tried to use Material UI that I used last year in RactJs but struggled with linking the Icons in XCode. Somehow I got it working on my original version, but then couldn't get it to work when transferring file to production folder. I need to do more investigating into how XCode works with React Native and icons.

```npm install react-native-vector-icons```

GraphQL - Did an 'old-fashioned' technique of getting ALL data and querying the object locally. I think a better, more modern, technique would be to use the GraphQL query language. More learning required.

### Future Developments
Felt it would be an interesting app to take the ingredients and see if it was possible to get the actual corresponding stock details from the database. WOuld then potentially have a really useful app on my phone in morning when trying to load the line!

### Dependencies
react-native
graphql
