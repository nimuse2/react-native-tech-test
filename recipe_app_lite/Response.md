### General

Time taken: Probably in total about 1 - 2 days. It took me longer to set up environments/ pipelines. Some wrong turns. Unnecassary complications. I feel I am rusty having not been commercially coding for almost 6 months!. And unfamiliar with some techniques and the database schema.

IOS/Android: Only tested on IOS

Landscape/Portrait: Need more work doing oin bigger full screen landscape

### Notes:

This is a 'lite' version. I tried to use Material UI that I used last year in ReactJs but struggled with linking the Icons in XCode. Somehow I got it working on my original devlopment version, but then couldn't get it to work when transferring file to github production folder. I need to do more investigating into how XCode works with React Native and icons/ fonts. Have left in the commented out problem code.
```eact-native-vector-icons``` is the issue!

GraphQL - Did an 'old-fashioned' technique of getting ALL data and then querying the object locally. I think a better, more modern technique would be to use the GraphQL query language on the server. More learning required. This would also affect memory at runtime?

### Future Developments
It would be interesting to take the ingredients and see if it was possible to get the actual corresponding stock details from the database. Would then potentially have a really useful app on my phone in morning when trying to load the line!

### Dependencies
- react-native
- graphql
